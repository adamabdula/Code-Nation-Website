<h2>About me</h2>
<br>

<p> Hello and thank you for visiting my website. I am recent graduate from the University of Essex with a BSc in Actuarial science. I really enjoyed my course which consisted of financial mathematics, economics, and statistical programming. I really wanted to further develop my programming skills which is why I decided to take part in Code Nations 3-week developer course. The course has given me the basic skills in Python, CSS and HTML. The course really sparked a deep interest in programming, and I am now very eager to keep developing these skills. I will be applying for the Code Nation 12-week course. I have also signed up to free online courses in Python and C to further develop this new passion of mine. I never thought I would be a programmer one day but now I know it is what I want to do for my career. I hope you like my website as it has given me the chance to showcase my CSS and HTML skills.   </p>

<h3> Hobbies </h3>

<br>

<p> My favourite place on earth is the beach. I learnt to swim before I could walk thanks to my father and now, I love anything swim related. I have been a lifeguard for about 7 years and hold various free diving international PADI certificates. Competing in swim races as a team and individual provides the skill to be competitive with a team spirit. Thai Kickboxing is also another passion of mine in which I took part in a few amateur fights representing my local club. I am also an avid runner having raised over £3000 over all my runs. I will be running the London landmarks marathon in May 2021 and be raising money for a charity called Tommy’s the baby charity that helps families with fertility and miscarriages.

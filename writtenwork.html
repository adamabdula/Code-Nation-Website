<h3>1.1	Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>

<br>
 

<p>The main purpose of using IT in a business environment is to increase efficiency. There are many ways this could be achieved. It would provide a method for real time communication between employees, suppliers and customers. It also, allows users to identify interesting facts and correlations regarding the data about their business performance to specifically target areas of improvement. All of this will contribute to a more streamline method of work, growth and development. 
</p>

<br>
<br>

<h3> 1.2	Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
<br>

<p>Firstly, gathering all the relevant information and research about the project. You would need to ensure access to all resources that are required such as software, manpower, data and any relevant expertise. It is also important to make a detailed plan that includes all the challenges and long-term issues we may face to allow efficient problem solving in the long term. Lastly, the digital project must be thoroughly tested to ensure no unexpected issues occur and that the objective of the project is met. 
</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>1.3	Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website.</h3>
<br>

<p>I had a few ideas about what I wanted to include in my website. I had to identify a method to organise my thought and options. This was simplified with the use of Trello. It provided me with a workspace which indicated exactly what needed to be done and what was already done. This was very beneficial as I was easily able to streamline the process by not having to think about my next task. I will plan my website by identifying exactly what I want each part to include. Here is a link to my board.  <a href = "https://trello.com/b/yVZRipvD/my-website" > Trello board </a></p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>1.4	Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h3>
<br>

<p>Plan that does not account for a change in circumstances. The project might not align with the business strategy, for example not considering the end users engagement. Also not including a diverse group of people and only “tech people”. Sometimes people are over ambitious and focus too much on perfecting the project over completing it. </p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>1.5	Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
<br>
<p>I would identify the scale of the company and identify what exactly the end objective is. Researching systems and software used previously by others to tackle a similar situation. Identify the software that is most efficient for the job.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>1.6	Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h3>
<br>
<p>Throughout the course I used slack and Zoom. These where vital for communication with the course guide and my fellow classmates. Without these two applications I would never be able to be part of this cohort due to the Corona virus pandemic. The use of Trello provided my self the ability to better organise my work and set out a clear plan to follow making things much more efficient. Visual studio was also very helpful as I was able to learn Python, HTML and CSS all on one application which also made things much more efficient. I was able to check my code and insure it was working as visual studio has a built-in error warning that specifies the location.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>1.7	Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3>
<br>
<p>Copy right might be infringed which may cause legal action to be taken against the team responsible for the project. Who is allowed access to the project must also be considered as it may contain sensitive information that is not to be shared. It may jeopardise a company values and legal guidelines which would have a sever impact on the corporation and project. </p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Unit 1 Outcome 2: </h3>
<br>
<br>

<h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h3>
<br>
<p>I have previously used IDLE to code in Python. IDLE can state errors positions after the program has been run.  However, compared to visual studio it did not allow me to see what my code was outputting without running the program on a different window. Visual studio allowed me to store my files in one folder and allowed easy access to each file.  Also, one vital advantage of Visual studio compared to idle is the automatic filler suggestions for code such as automatic double bracketing made it much likely to have syntax errors in my code. </p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Code pen, Trello ></h3>

<br>
<p>I found the tools used very appropriate especially Visual studio. It gave me the ability to code and see my results on the same page via the terminal. The instigation of error warning specifies the location and offers suggestions which I found very helpful. It also allows the user the ability to use different coding languages on one place. Really made programming much more efficient. I have not used a program like Trello before and mainly used pen and paper or notes on any of my devices. Trello was an excellent method of organisation. </p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? What would you change?</h3>
<br>
<p>I am happy with the website I have created. I really like how simple yet elegant it is with minimal clutter and a very nice background in my opinion. The hover effect on my buttons is something I really liked as it gave it a professional feel. For the positioning of my content I could have used more flex functions to align my work more efficiently. I also would have liked to have a sort of animated background that moves when a person clicks on one of the links. I also would have liked to add features described in Outcome 2 1.6 to make my website accessible to more people with disabilities. </p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h3>

<br>
<p>I would have liked to have a sort of animated background that moves when a person clicks on one of the links. I also would have liked to add features described in Outcome 2 1.6 to make my website more accessible for people with disabilities. </p>

<br>
<br>

<h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>

<br>

<p>I constantly tested every single change I made on my HTML and CSS code buy opening the window to see if the change has done what it was intended to do. This allowed me to ensure my changes are fir for purpose. I also kept changing the order of my code on visual studio as it worked best when I coded from top to bottom. One outcome I struggled with was positioning my text and background as every time I did this it affected my navigation bar. After some debugging and changing the order I was able to meet the requirement intended. My other requirement was allowing the user to clearly see my text. I inserted a box but decided to remove it as it made It more difficult to view. To meet this outcome, I just inserted a white text that is easily legible on a dark background like mine. Finally, the written work was done on Microsoft word and I just copied and pasted it into its correct place on Visual studio as I found this to be the most efficient method. </p>

<br>
<br>

<h3>Outcome 1 Unit 3</h3>

<br>
<br>

<h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h3>

<br>

<p> The use of Trello and Slack was very helpful in organising objectives between teams when creating our python game. Trello was also beneficial for my own organisation when creating my website. I will be using Trello from now on to organise other tasks or projects I will face in the future. However, I would say a drawback of Slack and Trello do not offer the person live communication so to overcome this we used Zoom which made communicating with others much more efficient as it mimicked face to face contact. Visual Studio is the best coding platform I Have used so far as it provided one window to create all my coding.  For my website I should have used Trello more and sooner than I did as I started working on my website skeleton first and had to change things afterwards. </p>

<br>
<br>

<h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h3>

<br>

<p>I have become much more aware of the importance of taking breaks. I realised taking as little as 2 minutes every hour really boosted my productivity and made me much more efficient overall.  Another way I identified was my attitude towards a task, when doing a piece of work, I always thought about the end user and how to best serve that person. This really helped as I was able to always ensure the end user in mind and keep myself motivated. Breaking a project down and setting self-imposed deadlines ensured I will meet the overall deadline. One method that I found boosted productivity the most was having standing meetings compared to just messaging. As this allowed myself and my team to share opinions and help each other much more efficiently. </p>

<br>
<br>

<h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Teamwork? Use of Slack?</h3>

<br>

<p> I will include Trello to plan all my tasks to keep myself organised. I have learnt the importance of face to face teamwork so I will always have stand up meetings where possible by the aid of Zoom or any other live communication platform. I aim to use Slack or any other accessible messaging platform to share documents or any other piece of work I want others to see.  I aim to network with like minded individuals and read publications in my chosen field to identify new methods to implement that have been tried and tested by others. </p>

<br>
<br>

<h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>

<br>

<p>Firstly, I will come up with a test plan and document this on Trello or another efficient planning software. The test plan must describe what to test, when to test, how to test, who will test and how much time it will take to test. I will research through publications and use my network to identify the most efficient methods and software to use to test my specific solution. Then after testing I will identify if the solution is fit for purpose by answering questions such as: Does it serve the end user as best as possible? Does it meet all the customers’ requirements? Is it as simple and clear as possible?  Is it as efficient as it possibly can be? Will the solution need updating in the long term? </p>

<br>
<br>

<h3>Unit 2 outcome 1</h3>

<br>
<br>


<h3> 2.1.1 Describing the content and layout for each Page</h3>

<br>

<p>All my website pages will have the same background. All pages will also display the buttons horizontally on the top right of the page with a highlight that is seen when the mouse is hovered. The first page is my home page which just shows the word “Welcome” in the centre of the page. The second page will consist of my written work for all of unit 1 and outcome 1 of unit 2. The third page will be my contact details consisting of an email phone number and location. Also there is a ink that accesses the about me section when someone clicks on Welcome on the home page. </p>

<br>
<br>



<h3> 2.1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>

<br>

<p>The use of images and backgrounds may not be “legal” as I do not own them. My background is from google images which is publicly accessible. I also found much better-looking logos than mine. However, these logos even though they just had AA which are my initials are logos of active companies and they own their logos. I was cautious not to use them as I did not have permission. I would say a constraint in this situation was not being able to copy some else’s logo and my graphic design skills to make logos myself. I decided to remove the logo as it made my website look less elegant </p>

<br>
<br>

<h3> 2.1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them. </h3>

<br>

<p>Some people with disabilities would not be able to use my website as intended. The colours I used where mainly white and black which could be seen by someone who is colour blind. However, to make it easier for people with colour blindness I could have added certain colours that are easier for such people to see. For people with more vision difficulties I could include an option that uses audio to tell the user where to go and read out the content. For example, I could add audio that states for welcome page click tab once for written work page click tab twice and so on. This may be a small factor but things like the hover effect on my buttons may affect people who are epileptic thus is should add a warning or just remove the effect. </p>

<br>
<br>
<h3> 2.1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>

<br>

<p>When using HTML and CSS the file types used must correspond to each program. For example, when creating a HTML file, I had to name my file as “myfilename”.html to indicate to visual studio that this is a HTML file. The same goes for CSS, in this project my file was named main.css which consisted all the CSS code for my website. Within my CSS file I had to correctly reference each part of my HTML files. </p>
